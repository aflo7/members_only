Project info
- this website is a small blog, where guest users can view all posts but no author info
- logged in users can see all posts with author info
- there are users with admin privileges that can delete posts

With this mini project, I learned how to:
- login a user (authenticate/validate using passportjs)
- register a user
- log out a user
- protect resources so that only valid users can see
- persist a login session as long as Node.js server is running
- use EJS templates
